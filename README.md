<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The portfolio will showcase demonstration data science projects.<br><br>

The main goal is to present the structurated code, visual outputs of each project along with conclusions and descriptions will also be published at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/radbys).<br><br>

Each script has been enriched with a header containing basic information about the project, tasks performed, technologies used and external external references and links.
